# RSA_Cryptography
Python Code to implement RSA algorithm of Public key Cryptography on Charm-Crypto framework.

1. RSA_doctest.py file tests a particular input and checks if all the parameters are working efficiently.
    type python3 RSA_doctest.py -v in the terminal to run the doctest file.
    
2. RSA_custom_input.py accepts a custom input and displays encrypted as well as the decrypted text.
   
Note:- proper installation of Charm framework is required(in Linux) to run the code properly.
